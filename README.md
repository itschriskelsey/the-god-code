V1 Information

The first version ran "unoptimized" boolean operations in Assembly, as in, operations that require time to calculate, 
rather than the traditional sense of boolean.

The tests I ran were around the seven second mark to run 340 quinvigintillion operations, but I wanted instant results,
which meant that the boolean operations I was running were not the correct ones meant for the Caskade programming language.


V2

The second version ran NOT R0, R1 (switchOn in Caskade) in C to see how it quickly it would run the operations. When I ran the
test one at a time, it was instant, but when I changed the C program to run 100 tests, it said the average per test was 30 nanoseconds
for completing 340 quinvigintillion operations.

Version two confirms that that NOT R0, R1 (switchOn in Caskade) is one of the boolean (true or false) operations that will play an
integral role in the Caskade programming language.


V3

The third version ran NOT R0, R1 (switchOn in Caskade) in C again, but running one googolplex of operations, and with 100 tests run, I was 
able to achieve an average completion time of a googolplex of operations in 10.32 microseconds.


Notes:

Caskade's purpose is to use this low-level boolean logic as the foundational interpretation of binary, which can then be compiled
and used by other programming languages for instant results.

This boolean logic can be used in different ways for any computational requirement to achieve the same end result while allowing 
for near-instant speeds, and when fully-optimized, instant speeds.

Pre-existing software of any programming language can already change their existing code to use this method and near-fully optimize speeds
while drastically cutting server costs and energy usage.

Once I have completed the Caskade programming language and compilers, every computer in the world, no matter how old, will become
a quantum computer.
